% This script demonstrates how multi-objective optimization can be used for
% generation of critical scenarios in simulation-based ADAS testing. The script
% implements an evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II, to find the optimal
% solution for multiple objectives, i.e., the Pareto front for the objectives.
%
% The original algorithm NSGA-II was developed by the Kanpur Genetic
% Algorithm Labarotary http://www.iitk.ac.in/kangal/
